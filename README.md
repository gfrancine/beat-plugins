# Beat Plugins

Plugins for the [Beat](https://github.com/lmparppei/Beat) screenwriting program.

## Developing

As the workspace is set up with the `npm` package manager, NodeJS is required to maintain and build most of the plugins.

Most of the plugins use the `install-plugin` command line utility (also found in this repository), which copies local plugins directly into Beat.

`prettier` is used for code formatting. Make sure it's installed globally and run `npm run fmt-all` at the root directory before committing.
