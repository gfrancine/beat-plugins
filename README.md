# Beat Plugins

Various plugins for the [Beat](https://github.com/lmparppei/Beat) screenwriting program.

- [Notes Bin](notes-bin)
- [Clean (CONT'D's)](clean-contds)

## Developing

As the workspace is set up with the `npm` package manager, NodeJS is required to maintain and build most of the plugins.

Most of the plugins use the `install-plugin` command line utility (also found in this repository), which copies local plugins directly into Beat.

Make sure to install all the root-level packages when developing.

`prettier` is used for code formatting. Make sure to run `npm run fmt-all` at the root directory before committing.
